# Introduction

This analysis explores the trends and patterns in Singapore's Parliamentary General Elections, focusing on historical data to uncover insights about voting patterns, constituency changes, and electoral dynamics over time.

# Data Sources

Our analysis utilizes official election data from:

- **Elections Department Singapore (ELD)**: Parliamentary General Election Results, candidate information, and voter statistics from https://www.eld.gov.sg/homepage.html
- **Regional Classification**: Manual processing to classify constituencies into regions based on Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) planning areas from https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate


# Methodology & Tools

Our analytical approach combines:

- **Python** for data preprocessing and statistical analysis
- **R & ggplot2** for advanced visualization
- **Quarto** for reproducible research documentation  
- **Specialized libraries** including tidyverse and plotly

# Original Visualization

**Figure 1:** Previous visualization approach

The original visualization presented several challenges: limited visual hierarchy, minimal interactive capabilities, basic color schemes lacking accessibility, and dense information presentation.

# Enhanced Visualization

## Key Improvements

Our redesigned visualization addresses previous limitations:

- **Accurate Percentage Representation**: Vote share percentages now correctly add up to 100%, eliminating mathematical inconsistencies in the original visualization
- **Clear Trend Indicators**: Implementation of up/down trend tickers (↗ ↘) providing immediate visual cues for electoral performance changes across election cycles
- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Enhanced hover tooltips and filtering options for deeper data analysis
- **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Clear sectioning with progressive information disclosure
- **Accessibility-First Design**: Color-blind friendly palettes with high contrast ratios
- **Regional Classification**: Constituencies grouped by URA planning regions for meaningful geographic analysis
