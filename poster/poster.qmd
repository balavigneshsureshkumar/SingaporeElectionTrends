## Introduction

This project examines how Singapore's general elections have evolved over 70 years. From voter turnout to the rise of opposition parties and redrawing of electoral boundaries, we trace how political participation has changed since 1955.

We started by critiquing an existing election visualization that was widely shared but misleading. Our goal was to improve both its accuracy and clarity using better design and clearer storytelling.

## Original Visualization

![Previous visualization of election data](./images/previous_visualization.png){width="70%"}

The original chart attempted to show election results by party but suffered from:

- **Inaccurate data:** Vote shares didn't sum to 100%
- **Cluttered design:** Overlapping text and crowded layout  
- **Poor grouping:** Constituencies were not organized geographically
- **No interactivity:** Lacked accessibility features

As a result, the chart was hard to understand and gave a distorted picture of Singapore's political landscape.

## Methodology & Tools

**Data Processing:**
- **Cleaning:** Fixed vote totals, removed duplicates, and merged yearly results
- **Transformation:** Standardized constituency names, calculated vote swings between elections, and tagged each with its URA region

**Tools Used:**
- **R:** ggplot2, forcats for statistical visualization
- **Python:** pandas, plotly for data manipulation and interactive charts
- **Reporting:** Quarto for reproducible analysis and documentation

## Enhanced Visualization

### Key Improvements

✅ **Accurate vote shares** that always sum to 100%  
🔁 **Dynamic arrows** showing vote shifts across elections  
📍 **Regional grouping** to reflect geographic logic  
🖱️ **Interactive tooltips** for contextual information  
🎨 **Colorblind-safe palette** for inclusive design  
🧼 **Clean layout** that highlights key trends without visual clutter

## Data Sources

**Primary Sources:**
- **Elections Department Singapore (ELD):** National election data including vote shares, turnout, and candidate information
- **Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA):** Constituency-to-region mapping for spatial analysis

Data was systematically cleaned and combined to correct inconsistencies and ensure comprehensive coverage from 1955 to 2025.
