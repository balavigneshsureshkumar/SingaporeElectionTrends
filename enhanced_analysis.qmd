### üîç Advanced Key Findings

-   **PAP Dominance:** Maintained consistent majority across all regions with 60-80% vote share
-   **Opposition Growth:** Worker's Party shows steady improvement, especially in East and North-East regions
-   **Regional Patterns:** Clear geographic strongholds emerging for different parties
